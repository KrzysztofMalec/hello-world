# hello-world
My first repository
I'm 29 right now, untill mid 2016 working as assistant store manager in popular chain store. I gave up that career to pursue as java developer. I'm learning a lot whole my life, read lot books from lot fields of knowlage, now it's time to arrange my learning and become programmer.

Now still learning some base of java, soon will create usefull program tu summary my basics, and go on with Java EE or Spring.
